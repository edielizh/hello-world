# hello-world
First Respository on GitHub 
... well if you don't count that this is the second time I had to create it

I'm trying to follow the hello-world guide, but things weren't popping up how they said, and then nothing wanted to update right.  {Sighs}  My first note in this read me section was a lot more hopeful, and I introduced myself.  My name is Edith or Edie for short.  That's Eee-deee ... not Eddie.
